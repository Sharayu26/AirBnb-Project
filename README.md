## Key Features
### 1.Data Cleaning and Preparation : 
1. Handling missing values
2. Renaming columns for consistency
3. Converting data types for better processing.

### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
1. Analysis of pricing trends across different locations
2. Insights into room types and their availability
3. Identification of popular listings based on reviews and occupancy.

### 3. Visualization:
1. Charts and graphs to illustrate key insights.
2. Histograms for price distributions.
3. Bar charts for room type comparisons.

### 4. Insights:
1. Price Trends: Listings in popular tourist areas tend to have higher prices compared to suburban or rural areas.

2. Availability Patterns: Properties with higher review counts tend to have higher occupancy rates.

3. Customer Preferences: Guests prefer entire homes/apartments over shared rooms, indicating a demand for privacy.

4. Seasonal Demand: Prices and bookings peak during holiday seasons and major local events.

5. Host Engagement: Listings with responsive hosts and better amenities receive more positive reviews and higher bookings.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
1. Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
3. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
4. Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text.
5. Kaggle : To use the AirBnB Listings & Reviews Dataset .

## Future Enhancements :
1. Integration of machine learning models to predict Airbnb prices.
2. Automated dashboards for real-time data visualization.
3. Deeper analysis of customer reviews for sentiment insights.
